When using the macros, the levels are constructed at parse time. The scales themselves are callable as functions if you need to construct a level that way (they are not exported):\n\njulia> using Unitful: dB, mW, V\n\njulia> dB(10mW,mW)\n10.0 dBm\n\nIn calculating the logarithms, the log function appropriate to the scale in question is used (log10 for decibels, log for nepers).\n\nThere is an important difference in these two approaches to constructing logarithmic quantities. When we construct 0dBm, the power in mW is calculated and stored, resulting in a lossy floating-point conversion. This can be avoided by constructing 0 dBm as @dB 1mW/mW.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that the reference level is just used to calculate the logarithms, and nothing more. When there is ambiguity about what to do, we fall back to the underlying linear quantities, paying no mind to the reference levels:\n\njulia> using Unitful: mW\n\njulia> (@dB 10mW/1mW) + (@dB 10mW/2mW)\n20 mW\n\nAddition will be discussed more later.\n\nNote that logarithmic \"units\" can only multiply or be multiplied by pure numbers and linear units, not other logarithmic units or quantities. This is done to avoid issues with commutativity and associativity, e.g. 3*dB*m^-1 == (3dB)/m, but 3*m^-1*dB == (3m^-1)*dB does not make much sense. This is because dB acts more like a constructor than a proper unit.\n\nThe @dB and @Np macros will fail if either a dimensionless number or a ratio of dimensionless numbers is used. This is because the ratio could be of power quantities or of root-power quantities, leading to ambiguities. After all, usually it is the ratio that is dimensionless, not the numerator and denominator that make up the ratio. In some cases it may nonetheless be convenient to have a dimensionless reference level. By providing an extra Bool argument to these macros, you can explicitly choose whether the resulting ratio should be considered a \"root-power\" or \"power\" ratio. You can only do this for dimensionless numbers:\n\njulia> @dB 10/1 true   # is a root-power (amplitude) ratio\n20.0 dBFS\n\njulia> @dB 10/1 false  # is not a root-power ratio; is a power ratio\n10.0 dB (power ratio with reference 1)\n\nNote that dBFS is defined to represent amplitudes relative to 1 in dB, hence the custom display logic.\n\nAlso, you can of course use functions instead of macros:\n\njulia> using Unitful: dB, mW\n\njulia> dB(10,1,true)\n20.0 dBFS\n\njulia> dB(10mW,mW,true)\nERROR: ArgumentError: when passing a final Bool argument, this can only be used with dimensionless numbers.\n[...]","category":"section"},{"location":"logarithm/#Logarithmic-quantities-with-no-reference-level-specified","page":"Logarithmic scales","title":"Logarithmic quantities with no reference level specified","text":"Logarithmic quantities with no reference level specified typically represent some amount of gain or attenuation, i.e. a ratio which is dimensionless.

For an attenuation constant of 3dB/m, we better calculate 6dB for a length of 2m.\n\nMultiplying a dimensionful logarithmic quantity by a pure number acts differently than multiplying a gain/attenuation by a pure number.

The prefixes on units (e.g. nm or km) may help to avoid overflow issues and general ugliness.\n\nUsually, the user interacts only with Units objects, not Unit objects. This is because generically, more than one unit is needed to describe a quantity. An abstract type Unitful.Units{N,D,A} is defined, where N is always a tuple of Unit objects, D is a Unitful.Dimensions{N} object such as 𝐋, the object representing the length dimension, and A is a translation for affine quantities.\n\nSubtypes of Unitful.Units{N,D,A} are used to implement different behaviors for how to promote dimensioned quantities. The concrete subtypes have no fields and are therefore immutable singletons. Currently implemented subtypes of Unitful.Units{N,D,A} include Unitful.FreeUnits{N,D,A}, Unitful.ContextUnits{N,D,P,A}, and Unitful.FixedUnits{N,D,A}.
